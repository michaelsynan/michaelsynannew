Recently I decided to put more time into writing, not just about coding but how society interfaces with technology. Full Stack Musings was born. As an undergraduate I stuied a lot of philosophy and science. Two of my favorite thinkers are Daniel Dennet and Fredrik Neitzsche. Both of these thinkers challenge accepted narratives and push readers to understand themselves and their relation to the world differently. 

When I was younger I was moved by humanism and other philosophies that promoted the idea of bettering oneself. For neitzsche there was the ubermench, for Heidegger he discussed "the calling" and in _____ issues of authenticity were central. Even in Karl Marx he spoke to a type of person that might exist if we lived in a free world where all our basic needs were met and we were able to pursue our goals and desires. 

The concept of improving yourself, rooted in the desire to be authentic, on some level, has been wiped from memory today. Instead of autnetically engaging with technology, it is the technology which engages us for its own purposes. Facebook got in trouble for this during the ____ elections and, more recently, their parent company has been sued for downplaying the harm their plaform does to youth.
