During my high school and undergraduate years, I spent a lot of time reading philosophy. This journey naturally led me to consider the philosophical implications of society's growing dependence on technology, especially as companies like Google started to transform into monopolies. The emergence of open-source as a counterpoint to these tech giants seemed promising. Around 2008, I discovered [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)—a popular Linux distribution even back then—and fell in love with it. Instead of following the recommended dual-boot setup, I wiped Windows off my school laptop and dove into the world of Linux. This step was more than a mere switch in operating systems; it symbolized a deeper alignment of my technological pursuits with my philosophical interests. As I grew older, I continued to engage with both technology and philosophy, concerned primarily with how to grow as a human being in a world increasingly shaped by technology. More recently, I decided to put these thoughts into writing, hence Full Stack Musings was born.

The term 'full stack developer' typically refers to someone skilled in both [front-end and back-end aspects of web development](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp), encompassing expertise in various coding languages, databases, and server management. However, in this context, 'full stack' signifies more than just programming; it represents a holistic understanding of technology's role in society, blending technical proficiency with a deeper appreciation of the philosophical and ethical dimensions of our digital world.

### Nature vs Technology

The question of nature versus nurture remains a central theme in both biology and philosophy, yet a definitive conclusion continues to elude us. As technology evolves and accelerates its integration into our biology and daily experiences, this question becomes even more pressing. This urgency arises because technology, including our phones and information sources, is created by companies motivated not only to provide services but also to generate profit. We cannot take for granted that these companies will act in our best interest, nor can we assume that the implications and side-effects of our technology usage are fully understood. Therefore, the question of how we develop and grow as humans hangs in the balance. 

#### Us Against Technology

It's no secret that Big Tech aims to shape our behavior. Entire industries have emerged, focusing on predicting our actions and intervening at just the right moments to boost sales or capture our attention. Tech companies, along with their commercial partners, are constantly escalating their tactics, crafting increasingly potent marketing campaigns and sophisticated methods for profit extraction. In this scenario, where companies dictate our choices and beliefs, the concepts of originality and authenticity become crucial considerations.

This issue gains even more importance in the era of generative AI, which has the potential to create an endless stream of content. This development could allow companies to allocate a larger portion of their budgets to advertising and delivery, further intensifying the challenge of preserving individual originality and authenticity in an increasingly AI-driven world.

### Authenticity, Technology, and Heidegger

Martin Heidegger, a profoundly influential yet often underrecognized thinker on technology, outlined some important questions that remain relevant today. His insights are particularly evident in his 1954 essay "The Question Concerning Technology." In this essay, Heidegger made an important observation: "The essence of technology is by no means anything technological." He elaborates on this idea, stating:

> Thus the challenging [of technology] reveals objects in the mode of ordering. The revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging-forth.

In this quote, Heidegger exposes the underlying logic driving technology and calls on society to engage with it on that level. This perspective directly centers the individual and places the onus on them for engaging critically with the technology they use. This can be challenging but, also Heidegger acknowledges, 

> where danger is, grows the saving power also.

In this quote, Heidegger is not saying that technology itself presents the danger and saving power, but, instead, our introspection of it. We can sleep walk through technology use and engage with it on tech companies terms, or do the difficult thing and elaborate our own response.

At the end of the day, Heidegger calls on us to use technology in a purposeful and authentic manner, instead of the other way around.
